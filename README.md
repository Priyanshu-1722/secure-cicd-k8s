# 🚀 Secure CI/CD Pipeline on Kubernetes 

## 🧩 Project Overview

`secure-cicd-k8s` is a comprehensive project that implements a **secure and automated CI/CD pipeline** using **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Kubernetes**. This setup ensures that containerized applications are built, scanned for vulnerabilities, and deployed securely using Kubernetes-native tools and security policies.

Key goals include:
- ✅ Automating the CI/CD lifecycle using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
- 🔐 Enhancing security using RBAC, network policies, and container image scanning.
- ☸️ Deploying workloads in Kubernetes clusters with hardened configurations.
- 📊 Visualizing architecture and workflow for better understanding and extensibility.

## 🔐 Security Measures

- **Jenkins Security**: Groovy scripts to secure Jenkins access and credentials.
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Role-based access control to restrict user and service permissions.
- **Network Policies**: Enforce pod-level network isolation and secure communication.
- **Image Scanning**: Use tools like Trivy or Clair to detect vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Secrets Management**: Securely manage GitHub and Jenkins credentials using secrets.

### 🔁 Flow Description

1. **Developer** pushes code to the **Source Code Repository** (like GitHub).
2. GitHub triggers a webhook to **Jenkins**, starting the pipeline.
3. Jenkins performs **build**, **test**, and **image scanning** (e.g., with Trivy).
4. The final image is **pushed to the container registry** inside the Kubernetes cluster.
5. Jenkins (or GitHub Actions) applies deployment manifests to deploy the **application**.
6. Kubernetes applies **network policies** to secure communication between pods.

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-1722/secure-cicd-k8s.git
cd secure-cicd-k8s
```

### 2. Deploy Jenkins:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pipeline/jenkins-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f pipeline/jenkins-service.yaml
```

### 3. Deploy your application:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/
```

### 4. CI/CD Automation:
- Set GitHub secrets for Docker login and K8s access
- Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger deployment

### 🚀 Future Outcomes

* **🔒 Secret Management**: Integrate **HashiCorp Vault** or **Sealed Secrets** for secure, dynamic secrets management.
* **📈 Monitoring and Observability**: Add **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **ELK stack** for pipeline observability and performance monitoring.
* **🧪 Policy-as-Code**: Use tools like **OPA/Gatekeeper** to enforce deployment policies programmatically.
* **🔁 Blue-Green / Canary Deployments**: Implement progressive delivery strategies for safer releases.
* **🧠 AI/ML Integration**: Use AI tools to detect anomalies in CI/CD behavior or scan results.
* **🌐 Multi-Cluster Support**: Expand the pipeline to manage workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters or hybrid cloud environments.
* **☁️ Cloud-native Integration**: Integrate with cloud platforms (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE) for managed Kubernetes and CI/CD scalability.
